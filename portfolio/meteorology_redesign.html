        <p>
          As part of a student-staff co-creation panel, I helped redesign the final-year Meteorology & Forecasting course at the University of Manchester. Our goals were to improve accessibility for neurodivergent students, shift assessment towards deeper engagement, and remove unnecessary exam stressors.

        <p>
          I contributed ideas to restructure assessments into dissertation-style coursework, improve modular pacing, and support asynchronous learning. During summer 2025, I will also be re-editing course materials using Adobe Premiere Pro to increase clarity, engagement, and visual accessibility.

          This work reflects my commitment to accessible education and collaborative pedagogy, where students help shape the learning experience.
