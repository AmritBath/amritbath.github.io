        <p>
          I was invited to speak as a student panelist at the University of Manchester Teaching & Learning Conference 2024, contributing to a cross-disciplinary discussion on the future of education. My perspective focused on the ethical integration of AI into higher education and its implications for access, adaptability, and neurodiversity.

        <p>
          I joined academics from MMU, UoM, and industry (FACE, Aunty Agency) to reflect on curriculum innovation, AI for personalisation, and the need for inclusive design in learning platforms. I also discussed how students can co-create assessment models aligned with future skills and wellbeing.
