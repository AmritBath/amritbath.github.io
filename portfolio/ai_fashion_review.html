        <p>
          This scoping review explored the rapidly evolving role of artificial intelligence in the fashion industry, focusing particularly on generative design, personalisation, and sustainable product development. I collaborated with researchers and industry stakeholders, eventually becoming a named author on the publication:

        <p>
          <em>“The Impact of AI and 3D Digital Tools on Product Development,”</em> published by Emerald (2025).
        </p>

          The project deepened my understanding of AI ethics, the limitations of current design tools, and the transformative potential of computational creativity. It also marked my first academic publication and professional research collaboration.
