        <p>
          This essay analyses <em>Hidden Figures</em> through the lens of racial visibility, structural bias, and historical omission. It explores how media can reshape collective memory, while also confronting the ways in which institutional barriers are smoothed over or softened for narrative purposes.

        <p>
          I argue that the film serves both as celebration and critiqueâ€”highlighting the resilience of Black women in STEM, while also raising complex questions about who gets remembered, how, and why. Themes of erasure, tokenism, and epistemic injustice are explored using scholarship from race and media studies.
